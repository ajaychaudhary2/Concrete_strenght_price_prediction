# Concrete Strength Prediction

This project provides a machine learning pipeline to predict the strength of concrete based on various input features such as the amount of cement, water, aggregates, and other components. It uses a pre-trained model to make predictions and preprocesses the data before prediction.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict the strength of concrete using several input features that influence the strength. The model is built using machine learning techniques and is trained with historical data. It includes a preprocessing pipeline and a prediction mechanism, ready for integration into production environments.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed, as well as the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies by using the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Steps to Install
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/concrete-strength-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd concrete-strength-prediction
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Making Predictions
To make predictions, use the PredictionPipeline class. Hereâ€™s an example of how to use it:

python
Copy code
from Concrete_Strenght_prediction.pipeline import PredictionPipeline
from Concrete_Strenght_prediction.entity import CustomData

# Initialize the custom data with input features
data = CustomData(cement=300, blast_furnace_slag=50, fly_ash=30, water=150,
                  superplasticizer=8, coarse_aggregate=1000, fine_aggregate=700, age=28)

# Convert the data to DataFrame
input_data = data.get_data_as_df()

# Initialize the prediction pipeline
pipeline = PredictionPipeline(model_path="path/to/model.pkl", preprocessor_path="path/to/preprocessor.pkl")

# Make a prediction
prediction = pipeline.make_prediction(input_data)
print("Predicted Concrete Strength:", prediction)
Files in the Project
model.pkl: Pre-trained model used for predictions.
preprocessor.pkl: Preprocessor used to scale and transform the input data before feeding it to the model.
CustomData: A class to handle and validate the input data.
